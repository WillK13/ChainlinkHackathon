# PaperDecentralized
PaperDecentralized is a novel opportunity for authors to publish their scientific papers without the need for a publisher. Using the power of the Ethereum blockchain and the ipfs, you can upload your paper in a smart contract which can be sold to anyone in the world. This allows for the authors to maximize profits on their hard work. Users can request papers and receive a pdf copy once they have an authorized hash. This eliminates the need for a middleman such as a publishing company who controls what scientific work is released and takes a majority of the income.

## Inspiration:
As young scientists aspiring to go to academia, we observed the importance of privacy to protect the hard work of scientists. For example, one of our colleagues published his work in a journal, and shared with us his concerns about recognition for his work and accessibility to the paper he composed. With that in mind, we wanted to solve this problem that is relevant to us. With limited experience in Chainlink framework and supporting platforms, we learned everything needed to complete the project from the very basics. We developed a website which allows authors to upload their papers onto the ipfs and then can be stored in a smart contract. People who want to read their paper are able to request it through the Ethereum blockchain, allowing the author to make an income. All team members come from diverse backgrounds and different experience working with the platforms and languages, yet we collaborated using replit and daily meetings as each of us contributed to a different aspect of the project that merged together. Although AP examinations caused a time constraint, we made efforts to learn and develop the project. Specifically, how the Ethereum blockchain works and web3 dapp development.
